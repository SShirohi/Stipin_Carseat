This i s aproject based on the heater in chair of car. This is most important in colder region or colder countries where temperature goes very low.
This is usde to make a essential temperaature on the seat of the passenger so that there will be no loss of heat from himan body to chair but makes makes it warm and full of energy beacuse of which passenger feel comfortable o chair without getting any problem.
