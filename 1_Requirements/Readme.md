## Introduction
Today world is on boom of technolqy things are reduced to as small as possible so thing can be easily done with less cost.
So we are finding technology where it never was before. Sometimes it is in plain sight, such as infotainment systems, GPS, and a head-up display. However, sometimes it is concealed in places one may not expect.
Seat heaters, while not new, are becoming more common on a wide range of vehicles. An added feature would be the combination of heated and cooled seats. Some of these systems use a heating element to warm and a separate fan to help cool the seat. These types of seats usually have a control module involved, which may need to be diagnosed if there are any issues.
Letâ€™s take a look at automotive seats, they do far more now than just provide a comfortable place to sit. Seats now may have an occupant classification system (OCS), airbags, haptic feedback (vibrating seats), or heated and cooled seats. These systems typically go beyond simple switches and relays and rely on control modules and computers to make them function.
It is important to know if a vehicle is equipped with these features, what parts are used in the system, and where they are located. This will enable you to check for proper operation to ensure a complete, safe, and quality repair.


##  Characteristic
 * Sytem is placed cheap and easily affordable by car companies.
 * Heater gets automaticalyy closed if no boddy is sitting in car.
 * Countries with cold climaate uses this systems to make body warm.
 * passenger can manuplate chair temperature according to need.
 * Chair becomes more commutable,standard, climate supportive and, substitutable for the passengers.

# SWOT Analysis
|  STRENGTH  |  WEAKNESS  | 
|-----------|--------|
|Quick respose|System is not as strong as for below 0 degree celsius|
|Each chair can have have there own twmperature indivisualy|Not responding if provid too much instruction|
Makes comfortable be user ehat ever be tempertaure outside|
---


|OPPURTUNITIES| THREATS|
|-----------|--------|
|Can be inovate and developed by new features easirly|due to IC heating some time may respond the system in wrong way|
it dosnot required special place can be placed like AC|Not be usable in hot temperature|

# 4 W's and 1 H
## Who  
Person in Cold countries Should affored it very beifical for them
## What
Provides a comfotable climaate even in cold time also prevent from several diseases due to cold.
## When
Mostly used in cold countries because tempertaure need to be maiatained.
## Why
If person is healthy than chances of accident will be minimize'
## How
can be innovate in future by providing different modes and with moderators and etc.
